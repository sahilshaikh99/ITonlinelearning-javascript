Objective:

Demonstrate how to change HTML content using JavaScript. Write code to modify the HTML content dynamically when a button is clicked.

Instructions:


1.    Create a new folder for your files.
2.    Create a new JavaScript file (with the .js file extension) and
3.    Save your JavaScript file to the new folder.
4.    Create a new HTML file and use the <script> tags to link the JavaScript file to this HTML file.
5.    Save the HTML file to the new folder.
6.    In your HTML file create new HTML heading and button elements.
7.    Add some text to your HTML heading element.

9.    Add some text to your HTML button element.
10.    Create a new function in your JavaScript file and give it an appropriate name using camel case.
11.    Inside the function body add some statements that will be executed when the function is called: Firstly use the getElementById() method to target the id of the HTML heading element inside your HTML file and store this expression in a variable name when the function is called. Then use the textContent property of the heading element to assign new text to the HTML element when the function is called.
12.    Use the onclick attribute event handler in the HTML button element to invoke the function when the button is clicked.
